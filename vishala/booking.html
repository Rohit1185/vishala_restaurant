                served </p>
            <p> your guests – since that is usually the first question that arises when planning for an occasion. The

                <h3>Your Occasion, Our Delight: For a Festival Called Life</h3>
                <p>We take immense pride and joy in hosting your event; we are honored that your choice is Vishalla.
                    Unlike party</p>
                <p>plots, marriage halls, or waadi organizers, we promote the patronage of nature lovers.</p>

                <h3>BOOKING</h3>
                <p>For a full day's reservation, we cater to 500 guests in the morning and 450 in the evening, which is the required,.</p>
                <p> minimum number of guaranteed guests. We charge for the exact number of minimum guests booked for the day.</p>
                <p> We will facilitate an increase in the number of guests; however, there is no refund against cancellations. We will </p>
                <p>charge for each additional guest at the same rate as for other guests</p> <br><br>
                <p>The timings for booking are from 9:30 am to 3:00 pm for morning events and 6:00PM TO 11:00 PM for an</p>
                <p> evening occasion</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>To enhance your experience, we request punctuality on your side. From our experience and for a graceful </p>
                <p>conclusion to the event and maximum care and hospitality for your guests, we recommend that you ensure your</p>
                <p> guests start dinner latest by 8.00 pm. We also serve foreign visitors and guests from the Royal Orient Train tour </p>
                <p>operators, which may coincide with your event date. Under such circumstances, we will make separate</p>
                <p> arrangements for their service. This will not hamper service to you, and we hope you will not object to such</p>
                <p> arrangements in spite of having fully reserved the area.</p>
                <h3>MENU</h3>
                <p>We require you to finalize the menu 15 days prior to the event date, in person, at 'Vishalla', and we suggest </p>
                <p>that you have female members of the family present to discuss the dishes.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After the menu is finalized and a week before the event date, you will be invited to taste the menu items, </p>
                <p>accompanied by a maximum of five persons.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We can serve up to 150 guests through our staff on an individual basis. For more than 450 guests, we can provide</p>
                <p> a buffet service.</p>
                <h3>Other charges</h3>

                <p>necessary for the customers as 'Vishalla' is a well-known restaurant, and we would not like to inconvenience our </p>
                <p>guests who may plan to visit on a coinciding date</p>
